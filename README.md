Description
This GAN implementation consists of two primary models:

1. Generator (G)
The generator network takes random noise (latent vector) as input and attempts to generate an image that looks similar to a real digit image. The goal is to generate images that are indistinguishable from real MNIST images.

2. Discriminator (D)
The discriminator network takes an image as input and classifies it as either a "real" or "fake" image. It is trained to distinguish between the actual MNIST images and the ones generated by the generator. The discriminator uses a Leaky ReLU activation function for better performance and stability.

Training Process
The training process involves two parts:

Training the Discriminator: The discriminator is trained to differentiate between real and fake images by computing the loss between the predicted output and the true label.

Training the Generator: The generator is trained to produce images that can "fool" the discriminator into thinking they are real. The loss for the generator is calculated based on the discriminator's response to the generated image.

The model uses the Adam Optimizer for both the generator and discriminator networks, which is widely used due to its efficiency and quick convergence.

Hyperparameters
latent_size: Size of the latent vector (random noise) fed into the generator (default: 64).

hidden_size: The number of hidden units in the neural network layers (default: 256).

image_size: The size of the image (flattened) passed to the discriminator (default: 784, as MNIST images are 28x28).

num_epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 200).

batch_size: Number of samples per training batch (default: 100).

learning_rate: Learning rate for the Adam optimizer (default: 0.0002).

How it Works
Discriminator Training: For each image in the batch:

The real images are passed to the discriminator, and the loss is computed for real images.

Fake images are generated using the generator and passed to the discriminator, with the loss calculated for fake images.

The total discriminator loss is calculated and backpropagated for parameter updates.

Generator Training: The generator produces fake images, which are passed to the discriminator. The generator's goal is to minimize the loss by making the discriminator classify its fake images as real.

Displaying Results: Every 20 epochs, the generated images are displayed to track the progress of the GAN.

Running the Code
To run the code, simply execute the Python script in your terminal:
python gan_mnist.py
This will start training the GAN on the MNIST dataset. After every 20 epochs, the generated images will be displayed, showing the progress of the training.

Results
After training the GAN for several epochs, the generator will be able to create convincing MNIST digits. The discriminator will become better at identifying real and fake images, while the generator will improve at producing images that are hard to distinguish from the real ones.

Conclusion
This implementation provides a simple example of how Generative Adversarial Networks work. By training both the Generator and Discriminator networks, the GAN is able to generate realistic images from random noise, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake images.
